## Features

  - CollegeEvent: school-wide events like holidays or festivals  
- **Schedule System**
  - DaySchedule: stores all events for a single day  
  - WeekSchedule: contains 7 days of events for one student  
- **System Algorithm**
  - Finds common free time slots across multiple students  
- **File I/O**
  - Saves each student’s schedule as a `.txt` file  
  - Loads multiple `.txt` files for group comparison 

## Building
The program helps each student record their own schedule, store it in a file, and later compare everyone’s files to find the best common meeting time.

## Running
After building, run it from the terminal.  
A simple menu will show up to add schedules, create events, and find the best time for everyone.

## Usage
Each person can enter their own classes or events with times, and the program shows when everyone is free to meet.
It also lets users “vote” for their preferred meeting time and displays the final chosen time in text form.
